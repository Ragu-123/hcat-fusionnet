# HCAT-FusionNet:  Multimodal Preprocessing and Fusion for Survival and Recurrence Prediction,using variational autoencoders and cross-modal attention for holistic healthcare outcome prediction.

This repository contains preprocessing pipelines and training framework for the **HANCOCK (Head and Neck Cancer Cohort)** dataset used in the **Hancothon25 Challenge** at MICCAI 2025. The challenge focuses on predicting **5-year survival** and **2-year recurrence** using multimodal patient data (clinical, pathological, semantic text, spatial histopathology, temporal blood tests).

Our solution introduces **novel preprocessing, imputation, and fusion strategies** to extract robust 512-dimensional embeddings from heterogeneous modalities, followed by **advanced multi-modal training**.

## Features

* **Clinical Data Preprocessing**: Advanced imputation ensemble + VAE-based handling of missing data.
* **Pathological Data Preprocessing**: Probabilistic imputation with graph smoothing and 512-d embeddings.
* **Semantic Text Processing**: ClinicalBERT / TF-IDF + SVD pipelines for histories, reports, and surgery descriptions.
* **Spatial Histopathology Aggregation**: Transformer-based aggregation of patch-level features with spatial awareness.
* **Temporal Blood Data**: Physiology-aware normalization, KNN refinement, and LSTM encoder for sequential signals.
* **Fusion Training**: Multi-modal VAE with attention-based cross-modal imputation, joint latent space learning, and uncertainty quantification.
* **Evaluation**: Binary classification of survival and recurrence, reporting accuracy and F1-score.

## Challenge Context

This work addresses the **HANCOCK multimodal dataset** provided for **Hancothon25 (MICCAI 2025)**. The dataset includes **763 patients** with modalities:

* Clinical structured data
* Pathology structured data
* Histopathology WSIs & TMAs
* Tabular blood test data
* Free-text clinical/surgery reports

Our framework is designed for **precision oncology**, enabling predictive modeling for treatment planning and follow-up.

## Performance & Insights

* The system demonstrates strong **generalization across modalities**.
* Temporal and pathological modalities improved recurrence prediction.
* Clinical and semantic features boosted survival classification.
* Fusion strategies with uncertainty modeling ensured robustness under missing modalities.
